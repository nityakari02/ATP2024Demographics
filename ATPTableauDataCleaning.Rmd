  # The W114 dataset contains the created variable MHEALTH3, an additive index of 5 mental health measures: MH_TRACK_a, MH_TRACK_b, MH_TRACK_c, MH_TRACK_e, MH_TRACK_CV. In addition to the index created from W114 data (MHEALTH3_W114), the W114 dataset also includes the MHEALTH3 index from waves 64, W66, and W83.
